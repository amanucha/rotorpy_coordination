# Game-Theoretic Coordination For Time-Critical Missions of UAV Systems

This repository implements the simulations for the paper "Game-Theoretic Coordination For Time-Critical Missions of UAV Systems" by Mikayel Aramyan, Anna Manucharyan, Lusine Poghosyan, Rohith Madhavan, Tigran Bakaryan, and Naira Hovakimyan.

The primary entry point for the cooperative MPC simulation is: rotorpy/examples/coordination_with_mpc.py. Ensure you have RotorPy installed and configured.
