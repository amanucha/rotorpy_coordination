This repository implements the simulations for the project: "Game-Theoretic Cooperative Path Following for Time-Critical Missions."

Ensure you have RotorPy installed and configured.

Running the Simulation The primary entry point for the cooperative MPC simulation is: rotorpy/examples/coordination_with_mpc.py
